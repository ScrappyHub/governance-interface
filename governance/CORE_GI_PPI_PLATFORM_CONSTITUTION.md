# GI / PPI — PLATFORM CONSTITUTION (CANONICAL)

Authority Level: Binding Platform Constitution  
Status: ✅ LOCKED | ✅ BINDING  
Effective Date: First Public GI/PPI Deployment

---

## 1. WHAT GI / PPI IS

GI / PPI is a deterministic governance substrate.

It evaluates proposed actions against declared policy under explicit constraints.

It exists to decide:
ALLOW, DENY, ESCALATE, or REQUIRE ATTESTATION.

It does not execute actions.

---

## 2. WHAT GI / PPI IS NOT

GI / PPI is not:

- an AI system
- an agent
- a recommender
- a reasoning engine
- a policy author
- a decision optimizer
- a safety wrapper
- a UX system

Any system that performs those functions must sit above GI / PPI and remain subordinate to it.

---

## 3. GOVERNANCE PRIMACY

All behavior in GI / PPI is governed by:

1. Constitutional Stop Layer
2. This Constitution
3. Governance Index
4. Engine Registry
5. Capability Matrix
6. Policy Registry
7. Lane Specifications
8. Schemas
9. Examples

Higher authority always wins.

---

## 4. DETERMINISM REQUIREMENT

GI / PPI MUST be:

- replayable
- audit-safe
- state-transparent
- side-effect free

Given identical inputs, outputs MUST be identical.

---

## 5. TRUST MODEL

GI / PPI trusts nothing implicitly.

All trust must be declared, scoped, and verified.

Missing information results in refusal.

---

## 6. AMENDMENT

Changes require:
- explicit Git amendment
- schema compatibility review
- registry update

Git is law.
